# partysmart
A web application in which people register their parties so that neighbors may anonymously send a complaint to the host via text message without involving any authorities. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes the React library for user interfaces, Node.js, and MongoDB. 

This was created as a team of five for CS 326 at UMass Amherst, but had since been removed from GitHub.
